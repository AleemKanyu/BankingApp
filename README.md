**BankingApp (Android)**

A native Android banking application built using Java and Android Studio.
This project simulates basic banking operations and was developed to understand Android app architecture, local databases and real-world feature flow.
As part of a coursework requirement, we were asked to build a terminal-based Java project. I decided to take this a step further by developing it as an Android application, using Java and Android Studio.
This approach helped me bridge the gap between core Java programming and real-world application development, while gaining hands-on experience with Android components and databases.

**About the Project**

This application is a beginner-friendly banking app that allows users to create accounts, manage balances, and perform transactions within the app.

The main goal of this project was to move beyond simple console programs and build a real Android application using Activities, XML layouts, and a local database.

**📱 Features**

->Create a new bank account

->View customer and account details

->Deposit and withdraw money

->Send money between accounts

->Delete existing accounts

->PIN-based validation

->Local data persistence using Room Database

This is a learning project and does not implement real banking security or online transactions.

**🛠 Technologies Used**

->Language: Java

->Platform: Android

->IDE: Android Studio

->UI: XML Layouts

->Database: Room (SQLite abstraction)

->Architecture:

->Activities for screens

->DAO for database operations

->Entity classes for data models


**How to Run the Project**

->Clone the repository

->git clone https://github.com/AleemKanyu/BankingApp.git

->Open Android Studio

->Select Open an Existing Project

->Let Gradle sync complete

->Run the app on an emulator or physical Android device

->There's an option for admin panel ,it will ask for a password ,its "962272"

What I Learned

->Building multi-screen Android apps using Activities

->Designing XML layouts for real use cases

->Using Room Database for local data persistence

->Implementing DAO patterns

->Handling user input and validation

->Understanding how real apps manage state and data

**Future Improvements**

->Improve UI/UX and layout consistency

->Add proper authentication and encryption

->Better error handling and validations

->Transaction history screen

->Cloud or backend integration
